    "The previous task demonstrated that chosing the weights of a neural network by hand can be quite painful even for simple functions. This will certainly get out of hand once we have more complex networks with several layers and many neurons per layer. But more importantly, the reason why we want to use neural networks to approximate a function is that (in general) we do not know exactly what the function is. We only have data points that describe the function implicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, we will design, train, and evaluate a neural network that can classify points of two different classes on a 2D plane, i.e., the input to our network are the coordinates of points in a plane. Net initial network we want to build should have one hidden layer containing 12 nodes (perceptrons) that receive input from two nodes each, and are themselves connected to one single output node that should predict a binary class for the given input (x,y).\n",
    "\n",
    "For training this network, we will create a training and a testing dataset. We will then create the network and use stochastic gradient descent to train all network parameters on the training dataset and evaluate its performance on the testing dataset."
